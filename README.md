# Steel Shapes Excel
The purpose of this project is to create a library for the creation of rolled steel shapes and built-up sections in VBA.
## Goal
The goal of this project is to create a simple to use library that can be used in steel design programs built in Microsoft Excel. This project is also being used as a demonstration for my engineering colleague who are interested in learning VBA.
## Desired Features
* Create objects based on data found in the AISC Steel Manual
* Create built-up steel section objects (plate girders for example)
* Calculate section properties for built-up cross-sections
* Create material objects to add the steel cross-sections
## VBA Editor Add-In
The VBA editor is notorious for being out of date with its features and not user friendly for larger scale projects with many modules and class modules. The [Rubberduck VBA Add-In](https://github.com/rubberduck-vba/Rubberduck) is recommended to aid in module organization and is required to run the units tests in this project.
